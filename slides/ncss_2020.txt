# What is this about?

* Building/adapting a data-centric web service
* Present information in several forms for humans
* Sharing data suitable for integration with other tools

---

# Skills you can learn in this masterclass

* Using and reworking data from a third-party webservice _(consuming a data source using Python)_
* Publishing data in multiple formats for a browser using templates _(Django templating)_
* Publishing data so that it can be consumed by other software _(publishing an API using Python)_

# Structure for this morning

* Background _(this stuff)_
* High level description of the activities _(so you can go at your own pace - use the slides!)_
* We'll run through the details of an activity when enough people are ready 
* Ask us questions during the morning - we're here for you! :-)
* 20 minutes of questions at the end _(about this, about tech, about careers, about Optiver, whatever...)_

# How about you?

Let's go around the room:

* Your school and what you had for dinner last night (was it good?)
* Have you done any programming before this week?
* Is there anything you're hoping to learn in this master class?

# Activities

1. Setup your environment and display data in your browser (machine readable and human readable)
2. Add fire status to the list of fires
3. Add a view to drill down by alert level  _*Is this too complicated?*_
4. Add latitude and longitude to the machine-readable feed
5. Connect the map to the machine-readable feed

# A step beyond...

* Infinite design possibilities, but some patterns work better than others

---

# API design

_something about the RFS data stream with its CDATA and what they could have done better_

---

# Consume the model or from the API

_we can do a map using a model and iterating over the entries, or we can consume the API. Why would you do one over another?_

---

# Question time!

* about this
* about tech
* about careers
* about Optiver
* whatever...
